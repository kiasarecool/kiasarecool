# 👋 Hey, I'm Nick (aka @kiasarecool)

I’m a self-taught tech enthusiast, developer, and problem-solver with a passion for building innovative solutions. Thanks to my **ADHD superpower**, I’ve gained a wide array of tech skills through hyper-focus and autodidact learning. I specialize in creating custom solutions, from **automation scripts** to **hardware integrations** and **custom plugins**. 

Everything I’ve built comes from curiosity and the desire to understand how things work—and make them work better!

### 🔧 **What I do:**
- **Full-Stack Developer**: From the back-end logic to front-end user interfaces, I work on all aspects of web development, specializing in **WordPress** and **WooCommerce** customizations.
- **IoT Innovator**: I’ve integrated **ESP32**, **Arduino**, and other hardware with software solutions to create automated systems, making tech interact with the physical world.
- **Automation Expert**: I create Python and shell scripts to automate workflows and improve efficiency, especially with file management and SMS integrations.
- **Twilio Integrations**: My custom-built Twilio SMS integrations help WordPress sites communicate effectively, automating customer engagement.

### 🌱 **Currently Learning:**
I’m always teaching myself new skills, and here’s what I’m focusing on right now:
- **Python**, **C**, **PHP**, **CSS**, **Shell**, **Java**, **HTML**
- Advanced IoT projects with **ESPHome**, **Arduino**, and custom hardware integrations.
